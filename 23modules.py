1. module is lib in c
2. it is really, a code library.
3. elaborately, its a file that contains a set of functions you want to include in your application
4. creating a module: just save the code you want in a file with a file extension .py
    ex)
        save the following code as mymodule.py.
            def greeting(name):
                print("Hello, ", +name)

    Then we use the import statement to use the model.
    ex)
        import mymodule
            mymodule.greeting("Johnathan")
    
    SO THE SYNTAX IS 
        moduleName.functionName(parameter)
